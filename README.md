# uasgeoref
Python scripts for taking UAS Images and generating world files and project files so images can be projected in the generally correct location in GIS software. The various codes use Exif info for geotagged files or .csv files exported from Agisoft PhotoScan for non-geotagged images, and user input of flight elevation or user input of a DEM.
